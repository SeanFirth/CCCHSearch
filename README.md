# CCCHSearch
Chrome Extension which adds an option to search the selected text on the UK Charity Commission/Companies House websites, directly from the right-click menu

Saves valuable time for fundraisers (or others who need to regularly check out these records!) - no longer any need to copy and paste company/charity names into a new tab!

# Installation instructions

Extension should work in any Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, etc)

* Download the zip file - [click here to download](https://github.com/SeanFirth/CCCHSearch/raw/main/CCCHSearch.zip) and unzip
* Go to browser Extensions page - chrome://extensions, edge://extensions
* Enable developer mode (Chrome, this is the top-right corner. Edge, this is on the left-hand side)
* Select 'load unpacked' and select the unzipped folder
* Ensure the extension is enabled

Optionally, you can then disable developer mode once installed and enabled.

# Usage

* Select some text that you want to quickly search - such as the name of a charity/company or a registration number
* Right click
* Choose CCCHSearch on the right-click menu and select where you'd like to search
* A new tab will open with the search
